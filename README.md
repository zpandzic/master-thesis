# Generic Cloud Platform for Information and Advertisements

## Introduction and Platform Overview
In today's digital age, the rapid flow of information and advertisements is becoming increasingly important. Existing platforms are often focused on specific types of information, leaving a gap for a comprehensive and customizable solution. This thesis presents a generic cloud platform for publishing information and advertisements. Developed with the goal of providing a customizable and scalable solution, the platform uses microservice architecture and message buses, which achieves a high degree of user control and adaptability.

## Analysis and Development Approach
For the purposes of this work, existing platforms such as Nju≈°kalo, Eventima, and MojPosao were analyzed, investigating their advantages and disadvantages. Based on this analysis, a new architecture is proposed that provides users with a wide range of functionality. The platform was built using modern technologies such as AWS services, Node.js, and React, thus ensuring the robustness and sustainability of the system.

## User Experience and Future Prospects
In addition, one of the goals is to provide an intuitive user experience that allows for easy navigation and interaction. The architecture is further designed to enable easy scaling and upgrading, providing a foundation for future expansion and integration with other services. The proposed platform not only solves the current challenges in publishing information and ads, but also lays the foundation for future innovative solutions in this area, including the possibility of integration with other platforms and geographic expansion.

### Technology Stack
- **AWS Services:** For robust cloud infrastructure.
- **Node.js:** As the backend runtime environment.
- **React:** For building an intuitive user interface.
